# RAPTOR
<p><b>Hey CYBER!</b> <br>
This repository is made based on RAPTOR application. <br>
This repository is made for RAPTOR purpose only. The programming team can submit their work in this repository. <br>
This repository is also accessible by some CYBERTWENTY IT CLUB member because this is only meant for the programming team. <br>

<b>What is RAPTOR?</b> <br>
RAPTOR is a flowchart-based programming environment, designed specifically to help students visualize their algorithms and avoid syntactic baggage. RAPTOR programs are created visually and executed visually by tracing the execution through the flowchart. Required syntax is kept to a minimum. Students prefer using flowcharts to express their algorithms, and are more successful creating algorithms using RAPTOR than using a traditional language or writing flowcharts without RAPTOR <br>
